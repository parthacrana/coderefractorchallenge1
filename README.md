challenge 1 -- code refractor 

Hello! This is Partha Rana! This is the readme file for the code refractor challenge! Week 1 Module 1 challenge! 

This repo contains both the html and the css file for the code refractor challenge!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

Long story short, some changes were made to both the html and the css file to make the code more efficient. Trimming excess/non-essential code have been commented out. 

This being my first challenge for this course, I do not know what to expect but I hope for the best!
